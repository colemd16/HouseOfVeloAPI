** lets only show 6 of these on the carousel to avoid rendering so many cards **
** Obviously all of these services belong on the Lessons and training page**


--- About section (4):

This section should be an automatic carousel with the same design as the above programs one. 

The only difference is they wont be cards, each section will span the width of the page

1. About House of Velo

Make this sound more professional but this is the jist -> House of Velo contains two pillars
of the youth sports community in saratoga county - Moore Velocity & 518 Velocity - Founded in 
2020 we have always set out to make a difference, teaching life through sports

2. Moore Velocity

same deal - Moore Velocity is a baseball training organization that specializes in player
development 

3. 518 Velocity

same deal - 518 Velocity is a youth baseball program in the Saratoga county area that since its 
founding in 2021 has only improved and put its stamp on the area both by winning games and 
producing fine young members of society

** lets have a button that brings the user to the about page where this is displayed on that page **

--- Testimonials section (5):

Just a nice fading in and out of kind words from their customers

you can put in stock ones for now


=== Lessons & Training ===

Obviously we have all the information stated above but I want this page to be really easy to use 
and with a cool layout

the packages dont belong on this page, there should be a view packages button for each service

I want it to be next to the book now button so they should be splitting the card in half together, 
not on top of eachother

Take away "Best value" or any distinction for the packages but definitely keep the difference in
pricing and how much the customer saves, that looks really good

=== Team Training Rentals ===

Not your Average Cage Rental
This is a coached team practice. A paid HOV instructor leads the plan, builds high-rep stations, and trains your staff so the same standards travel back to your field. Built for 7U–12U baseball and all-ages softball to get more out of their winter training. HitTrax data + competitions included.

=== 518 Velocity Travel Baseball ===

This page is basically empty on the owners current site, the only thing they have is

Welcome to 518 Velocity Baseball Club 
<button> 2026 Summer Tryout Registration <button> linked to a google form

We can definitely make this way cooler and useful for the players, coaches, owner, and customers
My initial brainstorm is kind of a central hub for all things 518 Velocity, like stats and 
player profiles that are exportable for college coaches to view

this team uses gamechanger so I dont know if there is an API for that we can use to get live 
game data but that would be really cool

would certainly drive way more traffic to the site

But for now, this is just a funnel to get people to sign up for the team

We could also automate the team handling process for the owner, i believe a lot of that is done 
 manually for him -> we can handle the payments for the team, show how many payments they have
remaining (most people pay over time) - they can also pay with check so maybe have (in the admin
dash) a way for the owner to say yeah I got their money

lets not move on this feature quiet yet but just want to get the idea on the txt

=== About ===

All of the information from the about carousel that was addressed above from the home page
